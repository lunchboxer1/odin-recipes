odin-recipe project.

To complete this project I had to use my new knowledge of html to create a simple web site that hosts a handful of recipes.

I have demonstrated how to use tags (headings, lists, img and a).  I have know commited a basic html boiler plate to memory.  I have used links to connect several html pages together into one cohesive package.
